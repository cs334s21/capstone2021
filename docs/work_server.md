# Work Server Documentation

## Summary
The work server interacts with a Redis database and clients.
The clients call the endpoints of the work server which either returns a job for them to complete or accepts the results of a job.


## Work Server Endpoints
It is required that the values `job_id`, `value`, and `client_id` are integers.

### `/get_job`
* Gets a job from the Redis database stored in the `jobs_waiting` hash to return to a client
* Returns JSON in the body of the HTTP response
* If there is not a job in the database then it returns 400 and the JSON
``` {"error": "There are no jobs available"} ```
or if there is no database to connect to it returns 500 and the JSON
```{"error": "Cannot connect to the database"}```
* Otherwise if there is a job, then it returns 200 and the JSON
```
{
    "job": {[job_id]: [value]}
}
```

### `/put_results`
* Accepts the results of a job from a client
* Expects a request with a body of the form
* Directory refers to the location of where the data where be stored
* Job id refers points to an integer value
* Results points to the json for corresponding job
```
{
    "client_id": [client_id]
    "directory": ""
    "job_id": [value]
    "results": {...}
}
```
* If the body does not contain `results` then it returns 400 and the JSON
```{"error": "The body does not contain the results"}```
* If the job was not in progress then it returns 400 and the JSON
```{"error": "The job being completed was not in progress"}```
* If there is no database to connect to it returns 500 and the JSON
```{"error": "Cannot connect to the database"}```
* Otherwise it returns a 200 and the JSON
```{"success": "The job was successfully completed"}```


### `/get_client_id`
* Increments the `total_num_client_ids` value by one and returns it
* If there is no database to connect to it returns 500 and the JSON
```{"error": "Cannot connect to the database"}```
* Otherwise it returns 200 and the JSON
```{"client_id": [client_id]}```
